  client as well as in standalone mode

  own key map, but only the first controller moves the mouse pointer.

  to background when started in this mode.

* Connection and polling timeouts are made configurable.

* Move threshold value is made configurable.

* Calibrated gyroscope readings handling is added.

* Special "disconnect" button is added. Any PSMove key can be mapped to
